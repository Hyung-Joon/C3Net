There are pretained models for C3Net.

[C3Net-Burst channel](): C3Net-Burst used global maxpooling, pretained model using conventional L1 loss + L1 UV loss (L1 color loss),   
whose number of AVC_Block is 5 and number of channel 48.    
The PSNR / SSIM result in validation phase is 40.55 / 0.99.

[C3Net-Burst block](): C3Net-Burst used global maxpooling, pretained model using conventional L1 loss + L1 UV loss (L1 color loss),   
whose number of AVC_Block is 7 and number of channel 32.    
The PSNR / SSIM result in validation phase is ??.?? / 0.??.

[C3Net-5_L1](): C3Net pretained model using conventional L1 loss, whose number of AVC_Block is 5.  
The PSNR / SSIM result in validation phase is 40.62 / 0.99.  

[C3Net-5_L1-color](): C3Net pretained model using conventional L1 loss + L1 UV loss (L1 color loss), whose number of AVC_Block is 5.  
The PSNR / SSIM result in validation phase is 40.63 / 0.99.  

[C3Net-7_L1](): C3Net pretained model using conventional L1 loss, whose number of AVC_Block is 7.  
The PSNR / SSIM result in validation phase is 40.80 / 0.99.  

[C3Net-13_L1-color](): C3Net pretained model using conventional L1 loss + L1 UV loss (L1 color loss), whose number of AVC_Block is 13.  
The PSNR / SSIM result in validation phase is 41.05 / 0.99.  

[C3Net-22_L1](): C3Net pretained model using conventional L1 loss, whose number of AVC_Block is 22.  
Also, the structure of AVC_Block is changed a little.  
The PSNR / SSIM result in validation phase is 41.30 / 0.99.
